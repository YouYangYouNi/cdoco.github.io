== Identifying words

A word in English is relatively simple to spot: words are separated by
whitespace or (some) punctuation. Even in English, though, there can be
controversy: is ``you're'' one word or two? What about ``o'clock'',
``co-operate'', ``half-baked'' or ``eyewitness''?

Languages like German or Dutch combine individual words to create longer
compound words like ``Weißkopfseeadler'' (white head sea eagle), but in order
to be able to return ``Weißkopfseeadler'' as a result for the query ``Adler''
(eagle), we need to understand how to break up compound words into their
constituent parts.

Asian languages are even more complex: some have no whitespace between words,
sentences or even paragraphs. Some words can be represented by a single
character, but the same single character, when placed next to other
characters, can form just one part of a longer word with a quite different
meaning.

It should be obvious that there is no ``silver bullet'' analyzer that will
miraculously deal with all human languages. Elasticsearch ships with dedicated
analyzers for a number of languages, and more language-specific analyzers are
available as plugins.

However, not all languages have dedicated analyzers, and sometimes you won't
even be sure which language(s) you are dealing with.  For these situations, we
need good standard tools which do a reasonable job regardless of language.
