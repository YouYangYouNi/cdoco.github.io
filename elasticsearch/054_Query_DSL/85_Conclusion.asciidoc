=== Conclusion

This chapter provides you with enough information to start running simple
queries effectively in production. That said, search and the query DSL are big
subjects and the more time you invest in understanding how they work, the
better your search results will be.  We will dive much deeper into these areas
in <<search-in-depth>> but before we get there, we need to understand why
Elasticsearch returns results in the order that it does.  In the next chapter
we will look at how results are sorted by relevance and how you can control
the sorting process.
